# TypingSpeedTest

App made using Tkinter module in Python.

It provides two modes:
  
  -user can check how many words they are able to type. Words are printed one by one and change by clicking "Enter" key
 
 -user can check how many words they are able to type. This mode is different from the previous one as here user should type all sentences.
